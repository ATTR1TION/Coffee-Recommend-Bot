# Coffee-Recommend-Bot
A twitter bot that recommends coffee options

This is my take on a Twitter bot that reccomends coffee options. 

It runs on [cheapbotsdonequick.com](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com) and uses the JSON and Tracery Framerwork. 

# It is still in progress.

It currently uses coffee options from [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/menu/catalog/product?drink=espresso#view_control=product) as that is the largest coffee chain in the United States. More coffee choices are coming. 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve or make this better, do let me know.
